# 349-Asgn2
 Assignment 2 for COSC349

 The files hosted on our AWS EC2 can be found in the file "AWS Version".
 
 Anything not in "AWS Version" was used for local development and testing and is NOT part of our publicly avaliable AWS webserver. 
 
 For this assignment we will be using AWS cloud software. We will host a website on an EC2 instance that will read/write to a RDS instance.
 
 I am using the VM's from Assignment 1 to test.

# NOTE ABOUT VAGRANT FILE
 The vagrant file was used to test and locally develop our webapp while the instances for AWS were being setup. This vagant file is not used to setup anything to do with AWS.
