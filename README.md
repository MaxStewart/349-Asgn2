 This project was about hosting a webapp on AWS.

 The files that were hosted on our AWS EC2 can be found in the file "AWS Version".
 
 Anything not in "AWS Version" was used for local development and testing via a VM.
 
 For this assignment we used AWS cloud software. We hosted a website on an EC2 instance that would read/write to a RDS instance.

# NOTE ABOUT VAGRANT FILE
 The vagrant file was used to test and locally develop our webapp while the instances for AWS were being setup. This vagant file is not used to setup anything to do with AWS.

 To view and run our webapp download and run 'vagrant up' from the root of this directory
