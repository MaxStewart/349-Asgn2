# 349-Asgn2
 Assignment 2 for COSC349

 The files hosted on our AWS EC2 can be found in the file "AWS Version"
 
# NOTE ABOUT VAGRANT FILE
 The vagrant file was used to test and locally develop our webapp while the instances for AWS were being setup. This vagant file is not used to setup anything to do with AWS.

 For this assignment we will be using AWS cloud software. We will host a website on an EC2 instance that will read/write to a RDS instance.
 
 I am using the VM's from Assignment 1 to test.
